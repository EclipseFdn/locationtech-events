# Call For Presentations

AvidGeo is pleased to invite proposals for presentations and workshops for its 2013 conference and 2013 Fall Spatial Ignite evening event to be held in Boston/Cambridge on November 7th. This conference and Spatial Ignite event are for those both currently or potentially working with geospatial technology including developers and users.

Presentations and workshops may cover any aspect of the development and use of geospatial technology. Attendance is being encouraged from anyone considering using geospatial software for the first time and the organizing committee is therefore keen to receive content which supports these delegates.

* Business Cases: building the economic case
* Visualization: effective presentation of information. There will also be a separate Call for Maps.
* Disaster Response: software, case studies, outcomes
